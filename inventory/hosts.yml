# Inventory sample of a pool of 3 servers with :

# - node2 and node3 as "worker"

# List here all servers within the cluster.
# For the sake of clarity and to ease the K8s clustering, 
# the NMaaS has been tested on top of a VPN overlaying several LANs.
# If not familiar, just use the same subnet for the IP_ADDRESS of each server as such :
#   nodeX:
#     ansible_host: IP_ADDRESS
#     ip: IP_ADDRESS
#     access_ip: IP_ADDRESS
    node1:
      ansible_host: 10.8.0.1
      ip: 10.8.0.1
      access_ip: 10.8.0.1
    node2:
      ansible_host: 10.8.0.2
      ip: 10.8.0.2
      access_ip: 10.8.0.2
